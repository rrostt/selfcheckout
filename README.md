# selfcheckout

App for self-checkout so shops do not need to build special infrastructure in order to get rid of queues.

Built during the swedish [Hack the Crisis](https://www.hackthecrisis.se/).

## How does it work

The app lets users scan barcodes in a shop to add those items to a virtual shopping basket (hopefully the items match the the ones in their physical basket). The user can then pay for the content of their basket directly in their app using Swish.
